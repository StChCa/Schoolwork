Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a game development company. They have designed a game called "draw it or lose it". The Gaming room is seeking advice and recommendations for what they can do to expand their game. They are looking to be a multi-platform game that encompasses both mobile, and browser clients. The software designed for this project includes the server-side software and some client side development.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In this documentation, I excelled at documenting the Domain Model portion of the assignment. The Domain Model portion required a strong understanding of object oriented programming concepts, and I was successfully able to portray knowledge of this information.

3.What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design helped significantly when developing the code. With the forethought that had to be put in to design the documentation, there was always a clear goal on what had to be done and where to go next.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one portion of this document, I would revise the Design Constraints. It was a challenge for me to determine the constraints, and I think that shows. The design constraints are particularly important because they guide the entire path of the documentation, and they are one of the first things the customer will see, and first impressions are important.

5.How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's need are the most important thing for a software design consultant to consider. Being able to interpret what the user is trying to communicate is key, even if they aren't saying what they really mean. To successfully interpret the user's needs, I read what they wrote, and combined that with my industry knowledge to generate the user's requirements.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In the future, I think i would like to spend more time up front gaining a understanding of the primary workflow of the software. I feel like I didn't fully understand the overarching structure of the project until later, but having this understanding earlier would be a benefit.

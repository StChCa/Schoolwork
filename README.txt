Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I developed was an inventory application that leveraged SQLite databases to hold inventory and user infomration. The app is designed to fill the needs of small business inventory needs.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I had to implement screens that show inventory information as well as screens to edit data. I used UI components that I observed in other successful apps such as a standard navbar on every page of the app.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I split the coding into various subtasks. Firstly, I set up the views with no function. Then, later I added the functionality to the views.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I verified functionality by testing in the android emulator, as well as on my personal android hardware. This process was important to prove that the app and development was working successfully.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate to overcome a challenge when implementing the navbar. This was not something that was covered in the class so I had to research this functionality myself and overcome issues along the way.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successfull at implementing the SQLite database and helper functions.

a. What is the distinct list of inspection results in the current inspections collection? How many are in the list? Use JavaScript code to find the answer.

db.inspections.find() //will print all documents in the inspections collection.
db.inspections.count() //will print the number of documents in the inspections collection.
There are 81048 documents.
(We could also use db.inspections.stats() to get more details that also includes the count)


b. What is the difference in the date data type for the business named “AUSTIN 2012” versus your business document insertion of “Acme Explosives”?

db.inspections.find({"business_name":"AUSTIN 2012"},{"date":1})
db.inspections.find({"business_name":"ACME Explosives"},{"date":1})

The above 2 queries return the date value for the corresponding business. By compring the results, I can see that 
the date included for AUSTIN 2012 is plain text, while the date for ACME Explosives is a Javascript ISODate object.
Javascript date object is preferred.



c. How many businesses have been “padlocked”? (See Value column above.)

db.inspections.find({"result":"Business Padlocked"}).count()
The query above returns 2 so i know that 2 businesses have been padlocked.
The 2 padlocked businesses are : "ACME Explosives", and "Antique Garage Inc"
